<p>After a few years in computer science research, working on very stimulating subjects such as autonomous robotics, augmented reality, 3D reconstruction and machine learning, my pleasure to share my enthusiasm for computer science has been growing. So, from computer science research I made a smooth transition to teaching it. </p>
<p>I enjoy computer science because it offers me an infinite source of puzzles, but it's not the only reason. I think that understanding computers and having skills in the field is paramount to understanding our world which is becoming more and more digital. So I wish for everyone to know that the computer science world is open to them. and I hope to give the keys to this world to as many people as possible in the future.</p>
<p>Luckily I joined a wonderfull team in EPFL which has a similar goal as mine (among others). That's how I ended up co animating the Thymio mobile robotics summer school with Professor Francesco Mondada to progressively animate the whole program. Finally COVID19 forced us to search for an online format, which led me to propose a new form of summer school based on micro:bit.</p>
<h1 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h1>
<p>This summer school would not have been possible without the support of the Service de Promotion de l'Education of EPFL. It also wouldn't have been possible without the trust that Prof. F. Mondada gave me and the opportunities he gave me co-hosting, animating and tinkering in the previous editions of the summer school.</p>
<p>I'm also very thankful to Anthony Guinchard for his thorough proofreading of this whole website and the time he spent testing all the activities. I'm thankful to him as well as to Christian Giang and  Aditya Mehrotra for the inspiration they gave me to integrate a makers touch and for their help in the preparation of the animation.</p>
