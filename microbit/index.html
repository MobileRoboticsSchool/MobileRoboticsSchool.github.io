                <h1 id="introduction-to-microbit">Introduction to micro:bit</h1>
<p>This morning, you will discover what will be the brain of our mobile robots: the micro:bit. You'll see that this controllers comes already out of the box with sensors and actuators, which are the building blocks of a robot, and you'll learn how to interact with them.</p>
<h2 id="why-microbit">Why micro:bit</h2>
<p>Different options: </p>
<ul>
<li>raspberry:pi: small size computer, GPIO, great for mobile robotics, can plug a cameras and everything we can plug on a standard computer, but complex system, not ideal for beginning.</li>
<li>adruino: great community, great capabilities, but does not come with integrated sensors and actuators, need electronics knowledge, soldering </li>
<li>micro:bit: recent but growing community, comes with integrated sensors and actuators which allow for smooth learning curve, easy interface with extensions, python langage. Limited amount of memory but not a problem at the start.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="programming-microbit">Programming Micro:bit</h2>
<h3 id="example-program">Example program</h3>
<p>Let's get started. For now, we'll only need the micro:bit board, a computer with a web browser (Chrome preferably), and a cable to connect the computer and the micro:bit. So take this with you and connect everything together. You should see an external drive appear on your computer called <em>MICROBIT</em>.</p>
<p>Now you'll use the web browser to access a <a href="https://python.microbit.org/v/2.0">Python online editor for micro:bit</a>. It you go on this page you'll be facing with a big black area with some python code. This area is the editor where you'll type your programs. On top of that you should see different buttons/icons that will allow you to interact with your computer, and the micro:bit directly if you are using Chrome. </p>
<p>For now, before doing any programming, let's see how you can put the example "Hello, World!" program onto the micro:bit.</p>
<ul>
<li>First option: you click the Download button. This will download the program as an <em>.hex</em> file named <em>microbit_program.hex</em>. To put it in the micro:bit, simply drag and drop the <em>.hex</em> to the MICROBIT external drive. </li>
<li>Second option if you have chrome: click <em>Connect</em>, select the micro:bit in the menu and click again on connect, and now the <em>Download</em> button should have transformed into a <em>Flash</em> button. This button allows you to directly put (flash) the program from the web-browser to the micro:bit. </li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of both options, an orange LED should blink on the micro:bit, informing you about the transmission. When the transfer is over the program should start automatically and you should see the execution of the program on the red LEDs of the micro:bit. Congratulation, you gave your first program to the micro:bit !</p>
<h3 id="your-first-program">Your first program</h3>
<p>Using the example program from above, you'll now learn the standard structure of the programs in micro-controllers. This structure is and always will almost always be as follow: first, an initialisation, then a loop. Take the time to identify those two parts in the previous program.</p>
<p>Following the same structure, here is a program to show you some functions that are available to use its buttons and LED matrix in python:</p>
<pre><code class="py"># Initialisation
# Get standard librairies
from microbit import *

# Loop
while True:
    if button_a.was_pressed():
        display.set_pixel(0,2,9)
        sleep(1000)
        display.clear()
    if button_b.was_pressed():
        display.set_pixel(4,2,9)
        sleep(1000)
        display.clear()
    sleep(100)
</code></pre>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercice 1</p>
<ul>
<li>1.1 Work out how the functions <em>set_pixel()</em> and <em>sleep()</em> work either by reading the doc (<a href="https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/microbit.html">sleep doc</a>, <a href="https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html">display doc</a>) or by tinkering with the code... or both ! </li>
<li>1.2 If you tinkered with the code, you might have made mistakes. If you did not, try it out and for instance try to execute the instruction <em>display.set_pixel(-1,2,9)</em> and see what happens. Normally you should see the error "Line ... valueError index out of bounds". That's basically what will happen if you ask the micro:bit to do something it cannot do. It will tell you what's his problem (the line), and why (in this case the first argument of set_pixel can only accept values from 0 to 4).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="variable-control-and-display">Variable control and display</h3>
<p>Now that you know how to interact with micro:bit, it's time for you to bring your knowledge of python into play. The goal will be to define a function that will help us work with micro:bit all through the week. Indeed, the function <em>display.show()</em> is powerful and can show many types of variables (integers, floats, strings) and useful to debug and show us some valuable information. However, as we saw with our "Hello, World!" example, this function is also not very reactive, while we need to be reactive not to have to wait 2 seconds for each piece of information !</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercice 2</p>
<ul>
<li>2.1. Define an integer variable <em>x</em>, initialise it to 0 and display its value using <em>display.show()</em>.</li>
<li>2.2. Program the micro:bit so that you can use the buttons A and B to increase and decrease the value of <em>x</em></li>
<li>2.3. Instead of using <em>display.show()</em>, use a loop and the function <em>display.set_pixel()</em> to display the value of <em>x</em> for x in [0-5] on the first line of LED: if x==1, 1 LED is on, if x == 2, 2 LEDs are on... </li>
<li>2.4. Define a function <em>displayPositiveNumber(n)</em>, that shows the value of an integer n (n in [0-5]) on the LED matrix</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We are going somewhere interesting with this function. If we plug some sensors to the micro:bit and we want to display some quantitative information coming from them, that's exactly the sort of function we need. However, for now, our resolution is very little (only 6 possible values can be displayed). To get a richer information, let's use the whole LED matrix. For this we'll define the following function:</p>
<pre><code class="py">def displayPositiveNumber(d):
    display.clear()
    for i in range(25):
        if d&gt;i:
            display.set_pixel(i%5,int(i/5),9)
</code></pre>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercice 3</p>
<ul>
<li>3.1. On a piece of paper, represent a 5x5 grid and set a number for each row and column, starting on the top left. For i = {4,5,6,24} compute <em>i%5</em> (meaning <em>i mod 5</em>... meaning the rest of the integer division of i by 5) and <em>int(i/5)</em> (meaning the integer part of i/5). Write down the value of i in the grid at the position (i%5,int(i/5)).</li>
<li>3.2. Integrate this function into the previous exercise to set the value of x using the buttons and display its value for x in [0-25].</li>
<li>3.3. (Optional) Rewrite the <em>displayPositiveNumber(d)</em> function using nested loops (a loop in a loop).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We are now equipped with a function which is going to be very useful this afternoon and in the coming days and which hopefully you understand well. Save it using the "Load/Save" button, followed by clicking the "Downnload Python Script" button. </p>
<p><a href="" title="display.clear,button_a.was_pressed, sleep; but in the end it's likely some won't have chrome or mu-editor and it's going to be a mess, while it's not a necessity.">comment</a>: &lt;&gt; ( Integrated sensors and actuators: 
When we build a robot, the main purpose is not data processing, it is to interact with the environment. For this a robot needs to perceive the environment and act upon it, and to do so it needs sensors and actuators. During the week, you'll see different types of sensors and actuators, but for now let's already see what comes integrated with the micro:bit. Sensors: buttons, accelerometer, compas, radio receiver; Actuators: led matrix, radio transmitter)</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This morning you saw one key component of what makes a robot: its controller. The controller is the brain of the robot which does the interface between its sensors and its actuators. But you saw more than that. Indeed by programming the micro:bit you already had a quick go at doing the interface between some integrated sensors (buttons) and actuators (LED matrix) of the board.</p>
<p>While this sensors/controller/actuators design is the standard design for mobile robots, it also applies to many other fields. Look around you and you'll see this arrangement is standard in technology as well as in life. A smartphone comes with sensors: a camera, touch(screen), microphones, radio receptor, accelerometer, compas; and with actuators: a screen, speakers and radio emettor. Human beings come with sensors too, although they are harder to isolate than on machine, but making it simple we could say that most of them come equipped with eyes, ears, nose, skin, tongue and proprioceptors (too often forgotten).</p>
<p>We also saw that for the controller to make the link between the sensors and the actuators, you need to give it a program. While you used the micro:bit this morning, what you learn applies to most other controllers: </p>
<ul>
<li>a programming language is most of the time composed of standard building blocks such as instructions, variables, conditions, loops and functions</li>
<li>the structure of the program of a robot comes almost always with an initialisation and a loop (and sometimes with <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-2/what-is-an-interrupt">interrupts</a> but I invite you to discover this when you are already familiar with the basics).</li>
